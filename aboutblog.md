Is Data fun?
No.

Data without insights are just meaningless series of numbers or characters.
I love diving deep into new datasets, discovering new patterns and exceptions.
Getting familiar with data and saying "I know something about you now", at the end.
And that's exactly what I'm going to do here.

This blog is essentially for me to showcase - and remind myself - what
data / methods I've been playing with and what I've learned in the process.   

I'm using R as my primary tool for data analysis and visualization, but don't be surprised to see Python code from time to time.

Comments / disputes / suggestions are more than welcome.
