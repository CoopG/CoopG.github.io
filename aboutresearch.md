The main focus of my research is expanding the application of MRI techniques in multiple sclerosis in order to improve diagnosis, better understand the disease, and develop measureable biomarkers to track treatment success. 

As a translational neuroscientist, I act as the middle-man between a number of different aspects of neuroscience. Primarily, I find interesting technological developments from the MRI community and translate these into the clinic by testing and applying them in multiple sclerosis. I also work with animal models of multiple sclerosis, which enables us to answer questions about the disease that require more invasive methods, such as histology and translate the findings from these experiments back to the disease in humans. 

My main expertise is in MRI analysis but I get to dip my toes in a wide range of techniques and approaches, thinking about how to innovatively translate findings or discoveries from one aspect to another. This means that I have the opportunity to work and collaborate with a wide range of experts in different fields, utilising my organisational, project management and networking skills, which I love!

The key methods I use in my research are: 

- Programming for MRI analysis (Python, MATLAB, Bash, FSL, ANTX, SPM12, CAT12)
- Programming for statistical analysis and presentations (R, Python)
- Neuropsychological assessment
- MRI acquisition in humans and small animals
- Histology and immunohistochemistry
- Analysis of clinical data (diagnostic information including lumbar puncture, cognitive and questionnaire data)

The main MRI techniques I use are:

- Quantitative Multi-Parametric Mapping (MPM)
- T1w/T2w Ratio
- Standardized T1w/T2w Ratio
