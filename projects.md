# Research Interests
My main areas of research are:
* cognitive impairment in neurological disorders (Mutliple Sclerosis and Brain Injury)
* quantitative MRI methods (multi-parameter mapping)
* white matter MRI

An overview of my research projects is coming soon. In the meantime, check out my lab's [website](http://neurodial.de/)

<!-- # PhD Projects
## 1: Multi-parameter Mapping in Multiple Sclerosis

## 2: Validation of Multi-parameter Mapping Signal Source using Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis

## 3: Investigation of the use of T1/T2 ratio to detect normal appearing white matter damage in multiple sclerosis -->
