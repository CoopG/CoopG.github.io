As described in my [about me](aboutresearch.md), my research has two main aspects: 

1) Translating MRI developments to the Clinic

2) Translating between clinical and pre-clinical research (Bench to Bedside and Back Again). 
     
Below, I describe our published data in projects relating to these two themes.

# Translating MRI Developments to the Clinic

## 1: Standardized T1w/T2w Ratio 
In multiple sclerosis, there is an increasing awareness that there is damage in the white matter that appears healthy on a typical MRI image. This "normal-appearing" white matter can typically only be investigated using advanced MRI techniques. While these advances have allowed us to better understand the pathology underlying NAWM, the advanced nature of these techniques limit their applicability in the clinic - they typically require additional scan time and analytic expertise that can be limited in a pressured radiology clinic. 

It has recently been shown that the ratio of two typically-acquired scans, T1-weighted and T2-weighted scans (T1w/T2w ratio), may reflect microstructural properties of white matter. As these are typically required as part of the clinical routine, the T1w/T2w ratio shows promise as a measure of normal-appearing white matter that could be applied in the clinic. However, the application of the T1w/T2w ratio in the clinic is limited because of some important technical issues - the quantitative value calculated by the ratio is sensitive to scanner-specific variation and choice of paramaters to acquire the T2-weighted image. 

Elsewhere in the MRI field it was shown that standardizing the ratio significantly reduces scanner-specific effects and produces a scaled value between -1 and 1. This overcomes the barriers to clinical application as the values output can be compared with values output from another scanner or a different individual. 

In our work, we are investigating the clinical applicability of the standardized T1w/T2w ratio as a measure of NAWM in multiple sclerosis. As a first step, we showed that the standardization method was robust against disease-related irregularities in the scan and that it was sensitive to tissue damage in established multiple sclerosis patients. Our next steps will involve evaluating this measure in early MS, investigating how it changes over time and in different centers as well as using it in retrospective analyses where only clinical scan data is available. 

If you are interested in applying the technique on your data or have any questions about our approach, please check out the [paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2019.00334) and feel free to email me using the link below!
