My main interest as a neuroscientist is how the disruption of neural connections (white matter) in diseases such as multiple sclerosis can effect how quickly people can respond to their environment and also their thinking skills (such as memory, organisation, etc.).

Clinically, I work with patients with multiple sclerosis and administer neuropsychological tests. This allows the clinic to keep track of any problems with thinking that might develop as the disease progresses. I also work in the MRI team, assisting with scanning patients.

My PhD research focusses on the application of quantitative MRI techniques to evaluate white matter damage in multiple sclerosis. For more information about my projects, see my [projects page](projects.md)
